Demo description
----------------

(todo)

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=svga_s3     # svga_et4000 also works
memsize=1

[dos]
minimum mcb segment=400      # Closing credits will crash if starting segment too low

[cpu]
core=normal
cputype=386
cycles=12000

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2
sbbase=220
irq=7               # demo supports 2/3/5/7 but default is 7 out of the ZIP file
dma=1
....

The demo supports SVGA 640x480x256 graphics mode. It can work with the
VESA BIOS, or if a Tseng ET4000 is detected, it can use the BIOS to set
the mode then use it’s own support code to draw the same.

The demo apparently crashes if you force SVGA when machine=vgaonly.

Start the demo by running START.COM. Use the arrow keys to select Sound
Blaster configuration then start the demo. Unless machine=vgaonly,
select ``YES'' for the Force SVGA option.

VGA vblank oddity
-----------------

This demo appears to have a programming mistake for some custom tweaked
VGA modes. It uses 320x200x256 VGA mode, but sometimes programs an out
of range value for vertical blanking end. This can be seen both on real
hardware and DOSBox where the first 17 scanlines are blank or missing.
