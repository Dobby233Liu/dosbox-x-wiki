Welcome to the DOSBox-X wiki!

DOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator based on [[DOSBox|http://www.dosbox.com]]. Like DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. As a fork of DOSBox, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for emulating DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 95, 98 and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. DOSBox-X supports multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS (MacOS X). Windows binaries (both 32-bit and 64-bit) are released periodically for testing. You can download them from the [[Releases|https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases]] page.

== DOSBox-X's main focus ==

Apart from DOSBox's original focus on DOS games, DOSBox-X gives more focus on accurate emulation of the hardware and many more ways to tweak and configure the DOS virtual machine. We believe that a better way to emulate the legacy PC platform is to give the user all the options they need to emulate everything from original IBM PC hardware with 64KB of RAM all the way up to late 90's hardware, whatever it takes to get that game or software package to run. Our goal is to eventually make DOSBox-X a complete emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based hardware scenarios, including peripherals, motherboards, CPUs, and all manner of hardware that was made for PC hardware of that time.
