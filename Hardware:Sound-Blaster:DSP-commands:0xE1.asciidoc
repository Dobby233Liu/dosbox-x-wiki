Changeable DSP versions
-----------------------

Some Sound Blaster clone support changing the DSP version at runtime.

Reveal SC400
~~~~~~~~~~~~

DSP command 0x6E, followed by two bytes (major) and (minor), can be used
to change the DSP version reported by the card. The SBPRO.EXE utility
included with their DOS and Windows 3.1 drivers does exactly this.

Yamaha OPL3-SA2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OPL3 control port allows selecting between DSP version 2.x and 3.x.

ESS AudioDrive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though not documented by ESS, there exists a register somewhere that can
switch the reported DSP version between 2.x and 3.x, discovered by freak
accident once.
