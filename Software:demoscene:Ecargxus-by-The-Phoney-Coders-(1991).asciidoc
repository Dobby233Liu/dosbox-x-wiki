Demo description
----------------

MIDI music, a moving box that spits out text, and some basic 3D objects.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=vgaonly
memsize=1

[cpu]
cycles=3500

[midi]
mpu401=intelligent

# By default DOSBox-X should choose your system MIDI configuration.
# If you just want to use FluidSynth on Linux like I do:
mididevice=synth
midiconfig=/usr/share/fluidsynth/soundfont/gengs.sf2
....

MIDI playback speed issues with DOSBox-X
----------------------------------------

At this time the demo seems to have problems maintaining a consistent
speed when playing back the music. It seems to be related to whether or
not the demo can maintain a full frame rate when drawing, and whether
VGA scrolling/panning is involved.
