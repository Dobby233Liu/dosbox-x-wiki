Demo description
----------------

Basic 3D object demo with music. It uses a flawed VGA unchained ``mode
X'' implementation.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=svga_et4000
memsize=1

[cpu]
cycles=12000
core=normal
cputype=386

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2
sbbase=220
dma=1
irq=7
....

Demo uses VGA unchained ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X[Mode X]''
but forgets to program the
http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/crtcreg.htm#14[byte/word/dword] mode
of the CRTC for the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X[Mode X]
rendering to display, which will cause it to misrender if VGA emulation
other than http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseng_Labs_ET4000[Tseng ET4000]
is used. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X[Mode X appears to be used
for fast polygon filling and page flipping]. Sound Blaster support
assumes IRQ 7, demo will not produce sound otherwise.

A cycles count between 5000 and 12000 is recommended to avoid flickering
and visible redraw. If the cycles count is too high, the audio clip
played during the opening logo may skip over the first 1-2 seconds.

Further testing
---------------

I would like to run this demo on actual hardware to see if it has
problems on non-ET4000 SVGA cards in the same way that it fails to work
under DOSBox.

Test results
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have tested the demo on the following hardware so far. ``OK'' means
the demo renders correctly (as shown in machine=svga_et4000 screenshot).
``Failed'' means the demo rendered incorrectly (as shown in
machine=vgaonly screenshot) where for every group of 16 pixels the first
4 are read. Result field will contain more descriptive text in the event
anything else happens.
