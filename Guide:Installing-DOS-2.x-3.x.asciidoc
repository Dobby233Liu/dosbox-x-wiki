## Notes

* For DOS 2.x, the maximum partition size depends on the OEM version, and should be 16 or 32MB using a FAT12 filesystem.
* For DOS 3.00-3.21, the maximum partition size is supposed to be 32MB, using a FAT16 filesystem, but in reality this only appears to be the case for PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. Other DOS versions are in practice limited to either 31MB, or their ``FDISK`` (or equivalent) tool is simply incompatible with DOSBox-X. For this reason the below examples will use 31MB for maximum compatibility between DOS versions.
* While it is possible to use a HDD size larger than the maximum partition size, this is not recommended as these DOS versions only support a maximum of one DOS partition per HDD. In effect, you will not be able to access the additional capacity from DOS, and it is therefore waisted space. In addition the ``FDISK`` option to use the entire fixed disk for DOS gets confused if the drive is larger than 32MB, and depending on the DOS version will either overflow such that a 40MB HDD image becomes a 40-32=8MB partition, or it will create a drive that cannot be formatted.

* If you specify a different size then 31MB for the ``IMGMAKE`` command, pay close attention to the output of ``IMGMAKE`` as you will need to adjust the ``IMGMOUNT`` size parameter values accordingly.

The ``IMGMOUNT`` size parameter should have the format of: ``512,<sectors>,<heads>,<cylinders>``.

## Creating a DOS 2.0-3.21 HDD image

First you need to start DOSBox-X, and create an empty HDD image file.

WARNING: Do not use the "Create blank disk image..." option from the "DOS" menu in DOSBox-X to create a harddisk image.
It will create a partitioned and formatted harddisk image, which is incompatible with DOS versions prior to 5.0.

NOTE: Until the partition is formatted, the use of a device number is necessary.
Device number 2 represents the first disk on the primary HDD controller.
....
 IMGMAKE hdd.img -t hd -size 31 -nofs
 IMGMOUNT 2 hdd.img -size 512,32,2,992 -fs none
....
image::images/MS-DOS:PC-DOS_3.2_IMGMAKE.png[Running IMGMAKE and IMGMOUNT commands]

You are now ready to boot the DOS diskette image:
....
 BOOT dos.img
....
Assuming that your uncompressed DOS 3.0-3.2 image is named dos.img and in your current working directory, it should boot DOS from the diskette image.

image::images/MS-DOS:PC-DOS_3.2_BOOT.png[Booting PC DOS 3.2 from diskette]

These early DOS versions did not have an installer, so the preparation and installation is a manual process.

You need to start with creating a DOS partition.

Run ``FDISK`` and select option 1 to create a new DOS partition, and confirm you want to use the entire fixed disk for DOS.

image::images/MS-DOS:PC-DOS_3.2_FDISK_Restart.png[PC DOS 3.2 FDISK restart screen]

After it is finished, press any key and DOS will reboot DOSBox-X and your again at the DOSBox-X ``Z:\>`` prompt.
At this point the HDD image is partitioned, but not yet formatted or made bootable, so that is what you need to do next.

Since there is now a partition, it is no longer necessary to specify the geometry.
....
 IMGMOUNT 2 hdd.img -fs none
 BOOT dos.img
....
You have now again booted from the disk image, and are ready to format the C: drive and transfer the system files.

TIP: As a IBM PC DOS exclusive, starting with PC DOS 3.0, there is the ``link:https://web.csulb.edu/~murdock/select.html[SELECT.COM]`` program which formats and transfers the OS from one diskette to another.
With PC DOS 3.2 this is enhanced to also support transfer to the HDD with the following syntax: ``SELECT A: C: 1 US``. The options represent the source, destination, country code and keyboard code.
....
 FORMAT C: /S
....
image::images/MS-DOS:PC-DOS_3.2_FORMAT.png[Running PC DOS 3.2 FORMAT]

You can optionally copy over the rest of the diskette contents at this point
....
 MKDIR C:\DOS
 COPY A:\*.* C:\DOS
....
You can also create a ``AUTOEXEC.BAT`` and ``CONFIG.SYS`` on the HDD with the included ``EDLIN`` editor.

From the DOSBox-X menu bar select Main and then select Reset guest system.
You are again at the DOSBox-X ``Z:\>`` prompt.

Your setup is now complete and all that is left is how to boot the image normally.
From the DOSBox-X ``Z:\>`` prompt this can be accomplished with:
....
IMGMOUNT C hdd.img
BOOT C:
....
You probably don't want to memorize those last two commands, so do yourself a favour and create yourself a DOSBox-X .conf config file and place those commands in the [autoexec] section of that file.

NOTE: You may notice that instead of using device number "2", we are now using drive "C". This is because the image is now partitioned and formatted and DOSBox-X is able to find the partition within it.
The advantage of being able to address it as "C" is that you can access the files inside the HDD image from the DOSBox-X integrated DOS, making it easier to transfer files.

## Creating a DOS 3.3 HDD image
Creating a DOS 3.3 HDD image is nearly identical to that of DOS 3.0-3.2 above with a few notes

* DOS 3.3 introduced the MBR partitioning scheme with primary, extended and logical partitions, that was used for all later DOS versions.
However, DOSBox-X has only limited support for extended and logical partitions.
You can create them, and when you boot your DOS image, you can access them.
But when you ``IMGMOUNT`` the image in DOSBox-X, the integrated DOS will only be able to access the primary partition.
* The maximum supported HDD size is now 504MB, but the maximum partition size is still only 32MB.
Since DOSBox-X has only limited support for extended and logical partitions, it is recommended that you only create a single primary partition up to 32MB per HDD image.
If you need multiple drives, you can create multiple images.
* Partitioned and formatted images created with IMGMAKE are not recognised by DOS 3.3.
This is because IMGMAKE always sets the partition type to type 6 (FAT 16), while DOS 3.3 expects type 4 (FAT 16 < 32M).
As such you need to use the -NOFS switch like with earlier DOS versions and manually create a DOS partition and format it.
* After you have created your image, due to the newer style partition layout, which DOSBox-X can autodetect, you do not have to specify the geometry to mount the image.
So your can boot from the HDD image with the following commands instead.

....
IMGMOUNT C hdd.img
BOOT C:
....
