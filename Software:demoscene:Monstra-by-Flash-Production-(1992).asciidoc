Demo description
----------------

(todo)

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=vgaonly
memsize=2

[speaker]
pcspeaker=false

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2
sbbase=220
irq=5
dma=1

[cpu]
core=normal
cycles=20000
cputype=pentium
....

You will be prompted for CPU & Speed, and music performance. The menus
have a non-intuitive design: Make the selection and then hit ESCAPE to
continue. You need to set pcspeaker=false because the demo turns it on
for some reason. Each demo part will run until you hit ESCAPE.

VGA oddities
------------

The ``Flash'' part of the demo, with copper bars and vertical bars,
relies on the VGA hardware not buffering the Line Compare register to
effectively repeat the same scanline down the screen as it does the
other raster effects before allowing the Flash logo to appear at the
bottom. If the VGA hardware does not act on the changed Line Compare
register contents during raster, then the Flash logo stays at the top of
the screen and none of the vertical bars are visible. The trick is
similar to one of the VGA raster effects in the DOSLIB VGA test program,
using the Line Compare register to make the VGA text repeat multiple
times down the screen.

A capture of the effect on real hardware is available
(https://youtu.be/RQPSE06Hd1M?t=12m55s[here]).
