### Notes
* From this point, Microsoft MS-DOS and IBM PC DOS have diverged.
* MS-DOS 6.x was available to both OEM's and end-users. However the only version (officially) available to end-users was the "Upgrade" release, which requires that you already have DOS installed. It will refuse to install on a clean system. The workaround to this is fairly simple. You boot from the first disk, at the welcome screen press F3 twice and your at the command prompt. You can now, if necessary, partition and format the HDD and transfer the system files (``SYS C:``). After your done, just run SETUP.EXE or simply reboot from Disk 1 and the installer, because there are now system files on the HDD, will allow you to install MS-DOS 6.x Upgrade edition.

## Creating a MS-DOS 6.x HDD image
Starting with DOS 5.00, installing DOS in DOSBox-X is much more straight forward, as you can have ``IMGMAKE`` create a HDD image that is already partitioned and formatted.

Maximum HDD size has increased to 8GB (or more exactly 7.84GB), but the maximum partition size is basically still 2GB, which is a FAT16 limitation.

....
 IMGMAKE hdd.img -t hd -size 2048
 IMGMOUNT C hdd.img
 BOOT DISK1.IMG DISK2.IMG DISK3.IMG
....

When prompted to change disk, on the DOSBox-X menu bar select "DOS" followed by "Swap disk". After the installation is finished, from the DOSBox-X menu bar select "Main" followed by "Reset guest system" and you will be back at the DOSBox-X ``Z:\>`` prompt.

You can now boot these DOS versions directly from the HDD image as follows:
....
IMGMOUNT C hdd.img
BOOT C:
....
