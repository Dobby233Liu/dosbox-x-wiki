International keyboard layouts and codepages
--------------------------------------------

DOSBox-X was developed around the US keyboard layout (just like DOSBox, where DOSBox-X is based on).
This is primarily due to limitations around SDL1. SDL is responsible for input handling, and SDL1 in particular
only supports US keyboards. As such when using the SDL1 version and a non-US keyboard, DOSBox-X will automatically
use scancodes with the default ``usescancodes=auto`` config setting to work around keyboard layout problems.

When using the SDL2 binary, scancodes are not needed when using non-US keyboard layouts.

When starting DOSBox-X on a Windows system with the default ``keyboardlayout=auto`` config setting, it will try to
set the keyboard layout automatically, depending on the host OS region, for a wide range of regions. This may not
necessarily match your actual keyboard, or your region may not currently be supported. In addition, the ```auto```
setting has no effect on Linux and MacOS.

You can set your keyboard layout manually in the [dos] section of the dosbox-x.conf file. For instance to set a
German keyboard layout you can specify ``keyboardlayout=de``. It will also automatically set a suitable codepage. 

Alternatively, the KEYB command can be used from the DOSBox-X command line to change the keyboard layout.
For example:

``KEYB UK``

This command will switch the current keyboard layout to the UK keyboard layout and set code page 858.

Alternatively you can also specify a different codepage by adding the codepage number to the end.

``KEYB UK 850``

Most Western-European countries would have used codepage 850 back in the day, but DOSBox-X by
default uses codepage 858, which is the same as codepage 850 with the addition of the Euro symbol.

Note that software that uses certain box drawing characters may not look 100% accurate unless codepage 437
(default US codepage) is used. But this codepage lacks many diacritic glyphs that may be needed for regional
support. As such a choice may have to be made between support for those box drawing characters or diacritic glyphs.

The Japanese keyboard layout is also supported in NEC PC-98 mode. You can start DOSBox-X in PC-98 mode directly
by setting "machine=pc98" in the [dosbox] section of the dosbox-x.conf file.

If you find that a keyboard layout is not yet supported by DOSBox-X, in order to add additional layouts for use
with DOSBox-X, please see file [README.keyboard-layout-handling](README.keyboard-layout-handling)
on how to do so as a developer.

Regional settings
-----------------

Regional settings can be set in the [config] section of the DOSBox-x config file by use of the ```COUNTRY=```
setting. This defaults to 1, which is the US. This setting influences date and time format as used by DOSBox-X,
for instance by the ``DIR`` command. It may also influence regional settings in other applications.

``COUNTRY=044``

Will cause DOSBox-X to use the UK date and time format. A list of country codes can be found on the [FreeDOS wiki](http://wiki.freedos.org/wiki/index.php/Country_codes).
