Demo description

(todo)

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
memsize=16
machine=svga_s3

[cpu]
cycles=max    # set to 250000 if you want to capture instead
core=dynamic
cputype=pentium

[sblaster]
sbtype=sb16

[gus]
gus=true
....

GUS emulation should be enabled so the demo can automatically choose it
for best music audio quality. The high cycles count is needed for the 3D
objects and effects used in the demo. If you only want to watch the demo
instead, you should consider cycles=max instead.

The demo will not start immediately. It needs to load some data first
and process it, which can take 30-60 seconds in DOSBox-X on a quad core
Intel i5 laptop.
