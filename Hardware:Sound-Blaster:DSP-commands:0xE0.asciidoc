unsigned char data_byte,tmp;

/* pick a data byte to use */

DSP_Write(0xE0);
DSP_Write(data_byte);
tmp = DSP_Read();
if ((data_byte ^ 0xFF) == tmp) {

Write command 0xE0, then some data byte. Read from the DSP. The byte
returned should be the value you wrote, with all bits inverted. This
command is documented as only supported by the Sound Blaster 2.0
