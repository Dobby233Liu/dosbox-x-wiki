Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
memsize=16
machine=svga_s3

[cpu]
cycles=max    # set to 250000 if you want to capture instead
core=dynamic
cputype=pentium

[sblaster]
sbtype=sb16

[gus]
gus=true
....

GUS emulation should be enabled so the demo can automatically choose it
for best music audio quality. You should run SETUP.EXE to configure the
demo for Gravis Ultrasound GF1 hardware mixing. The high cycles count is
needed for the 3D objects and effects used in the demo. If you only want
to watch the demo instead, you should consider cycles=max instead. Note
that the README.TXT also strongly recommends ``a fast Pentium''.

The demo may sit at a black screen for up to 30 seconds before running
at startup. Be patient before killing the DOS session and restarting.
