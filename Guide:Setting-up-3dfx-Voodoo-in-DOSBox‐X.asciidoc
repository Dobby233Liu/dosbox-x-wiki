# Setting up 3dfx Voodoo in DOSBox-X

toc::[]

# Overview
The 3dfx Voodoo is a 3D accelerator chipset released in late 1996, and sold by various graphic card manufacturers.
The original Voodoo 1 adapters need to be used in conjunction with a separate VGA adapter in a pass-through manor.

As these where the early days of 3D acceleration, it uses it's own proprietary Glide API which was supported by many DOS and Windows 9x games at the time.

DOSBox-X has support for emulating the 3dfx Voodoo in one of two modes.

* Low-Level Emulation, emulating the 3dfx Voodoo 1 hardware
* High-Level Emulation, where the Glide API calls are passed through to the host OS.

## Voodoo options
This section will list the available 3dfx Voodoo configuration options that DOSBox-X provides.
Unless otherwise noted the options effecting the 3dfx Voodoo emulation are in the [pci] section of the dosbox-x config file.

### voodoo
* Default value: auto
* Possible values: auto, false, software, opengl

Enables low-level voodoo hardware emulation

The "auto" option means it will try to use OpenGL if possible, and otherwise fallback to software rendering.

### glide
* Default value: false
* Possible values: true, false

Enables high-level Glide API pass-through to the host OS.
This requires that the host OS has a Glide API library installed, and in addition it requires a special GLIDE2X.OVL file to be used in DOSBox-X.

### lfb
* Default value: full_noaux
* Possible values: full, full_noaux, read, read_noaux, write, write_noaux, none

Enable LFB (Line-Fill-Buffer) CPU Cache access for Glide.

NOTE: OpenGlide does not support locking aux buffer, as such please use _noaux modes.

### splash
* Default value: true
* Possible values: true, false

Show 3dfx splash screen

This option only applies when using the high-level Glide API emulation.
In addition, this is only supported on Windows, and it requires 3dfxSpl2.dll to be installed.

### ignore undefined msr
* Default value: false
* Possible values: true, false

This setting is located in the [cpu] section of the dosbox-x config file.

Normally the CPU will fire an Invalid Opcode exception in the case of an undefined MSR (Model-specific register).

This option is off by default, enable if using software or drivers that assumes the presence of certain MSR registers without checking.
If you are using certain versions of the 3Dfx glide drivers for MS-DOS you will need to set this to TRUE as 3Dfx appears to have coded GLIDE2X.OVL to assume the presence of Pentium Pro/Pentium II MTRR registers.

Another way to circumvent this issue with the 3dfx drivers, is by emulating a Pentium Pro CPU in DOSBox-X by setting ``cputype=ppro_slow`` in the [cpu] section of your DOSBox-X config file.

## Low Level emulation
This emulation mode has been supported by DOSBox-X for a long time.
It emulates the original 3dfx Voodoo 1 chipset, and therefore works with the official 3dfx DOS and Windows drivers.
It is the easiest mode to get working, and is in fact enabled by default.
Depending on the game, you may not have to do anything, or you just need to select 3dfx Voodoo in the setup program.
Some other games may require that you install a patch, or that you run a different executable to start in 3dfx mode.

If you want to use 3dfx Voodoo emulation when running Windows 95 or 98 in DOSBox-X, you need to use this mode.

## High Level emulation
This mode requires DOSBox-X 0.83.5 or newer, and it only works for DOS games that use GLIDE2X.OVL.

Instead of emulating the 3dfx hardware, this method converts the Glide API calls to OpenGL and is therefore more efficient.
However, it also requires a few more steps to get working.
It requires that the Host OS has a Glide API library installed (glide2x.dll, libglide2x.so or libglide2x.dylib), and that you use the special GLIDE2X.OVL provided in DOSBox-X, instead of one that may be provided with the game or provided by 3dfx.

When DOSBox-X is started with glide=true the special GLIDE2X.OVL file can be conveniently found on the emulated Z: drive. If the game already provides a GLIDE2X.DLL file located in the game directory, then you need to rename the gameâ€™s original GLIDE2X.OVL file to something like GLIDE2X.ORG, and after that you can also optionally copy the GLIDE2X.OVL from the Z: drive to the game directory for use with the game.

NOTE: It is good to keep a backup of the games original GLIDE2X.OVL file, as you will need it if you decide you want to use the 3dfx Voodoo hardware emulation later.
Hardware emulation requires that you use the games original Glide library, and not the special one used for pass-through.

### Windows: Installing glide2x.dll
NOTE: Although this library has the same filename as the old Windows Glide library for real 3dfx Voodoo adapters, it is in fact not the same.
The library used here converts Glide calls to OpenGL, and will not work with a real 3dfx Voodoo adapter.
It may be possible to use a real 3dfx Voodoo adapter with the original glide2x.dll with the right hardware and software setup, but that has not been tested.

instructions needed... Which glide2x.dll implementation? Glidos, DgVoodoo, nGlide or OpenGlide? Note that 32-bit glide2x.dll is required by 32-bit DOSBox-X binaries, and 64-bit glide2x.dll is required by 64-bit DOSBox-X binaries.

### Linux: Installing libglide2x.so
NOTE: Although this library has the same filename as the old Linux Glide library for real 3dfx Voodoo adapters, it is in fact not the same.
The library used here converts Glide calls to OpenGL, and will not work with a real 3dfx Voodoo adapter.
It may be possible to use a real 3dfx Voodoo adapter with the original libglide2x.so with the right hardware and software setup, but that has not been tested.

Unfortunately this library is not included with any of the modern Linux distributions, as such you need to compile it yourself.
The following steps assume that you have the necessary compiler, developer tools and header files already installed.

Run the following commands from a Linux terminal:

....
git clone https://github.com/voyageur/openglide.git
cd openglide
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
....

libglide2x.so will by default be installed in /usr/local/lib which may or may-not be in your default library path.
To check if ldconfig found the library, run the following command:

....
ldconfig -p|grep glide
....
You should get an output similar to this:
....
	libglide2x.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/libglide2x.so.0
	libglide2x.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/libglide2x.so
....
In the above example it found the libglide2x.so library.
If the ldconfig command returns nothing, you need to add the /usr/local/lib directory to your library path and re-run ldconfig as follows:
....
sudo sh -c 'echo /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usr-local-lib.conf'
sudo ldconfig
....

### macOS: Installing libglide2x.dylib
