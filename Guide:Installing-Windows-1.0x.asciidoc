# Overview
## Editions this applies to

* Windows 1.01
** Initial US release version
* Windows 1.02
** International release
** Support for international keyboards
** Support for regional settings like time and date format
** Support for A4 paper
* Windows 1.03
** Additional drivers
** Adds support for Tandy graphics
* Windows 1.04
** Adds support for the IBM PS/2 (but no support for PS/2 mouse or VGA)

Windows 1.0x was the first versions of the Microsoft Windows line, available for both Retail and via OEM. A runtime version was also included with some applications.

The retail release of Windows 1.04 adds support for the IBM PS/2, but *DID NOT* add support for the IBM PS/2 Mouse, or the newer VGA, MCGA or 8514/A video adapters.
IBM distributed a special OEM version of Windows 1.04 as part of the "IBM PS/2 Collegiate Kit", which *DOES* have support for these features.

According to Microsoft, _Windows 1.0 required a minimum of 256 kilobyte, two double-sided disk drives and a graphics adapter.
A hard disk and 512KB memory are recommended for running multiple programs or when using DOS 3.0 or higher._

In reality, it also needs at least DOS 2.0, and the two disk drives are not mandatory if there is a harddisk.
It only supports up to 640KB base memory (no support for EMS/XMS/UMB memory).

## README.1ST
Apart from the special IBM OEM version of Windows 1.04, there is no support for the default PS/2 mouse that DOSBox-X emulates.
Therefore it is necessary if you want mouse support to enable serial mouse support.

In addition, Windows 1.0x has problems starting if the DOS version is 4.0 or higher.
Therefore it is necessary to set the reported DOS version to something like 3.30.

# DOSBox-X config file
It is recommended that you create a custom DOSBox-X config file for running Windows 1.0x
....
[sdl]
autolock=true

[dosbox]
title=Windows 1.0x

[dos]
ver=3.3

[serial]
# Comment out the line below if you have the special OEM Windows 1.04
# release from the IBM PS/2 Collegiate Kit, which supports PS/2 mouse.
serial1=serialmouse

[parallel]
parallel1=printer

[printer]
multipage=true
timeout=5000

[render]
scaler=none

[autoexec]
....

Copy the above config and save it as *win1x.conf*

# Preparing for installation
The installation will be into a mounted folder, and Windows 1.0x will run from the integrated DOS that DOSBox-X provides.
You can optionally install real DOS into DOSBox-X and install Windows 1.0x in that, but there is no known advantage to doing so.

Start by creating a directory on your system that your going to use (mount) as your Windows 1.0x C: drive. Valid examples:

* For Windows hosts
** C:\winroot
** C:\users\myuser\win1x
* For Linux hosts
** /home/myuser/winroot
** /home/myuser/windows/win1x

Note: For Windows users, do *NOT* mount the root of your C: drive as the DOSBox-X C: drive! (e.g. ``MOUNT C C:\`` should NOT be done)

Windows 1.0x versions were shipped on diskettes, requiring anywhere between 3 and 7 disks, depending on media-type and windows version.
And while it is definitely possible to install Windows 1.0x from diskette images in DOSBox-X, the disk-swap process for this is rather tedious for large number of disks.
As such it is highly recommended to make a directory such as "INSTALL" and copy the contents of ALL the diskettes into this directory.
This way there is no need to swap disks during the installation process.

## Example of extracting files from disk images
There are various ways to extract the contents of disk images, such as 7zip on Windows or "Disk Image Mounter" on Linux.
In this example, DOSBox-X itself is used to mount a disk image, copy its contents into a folder, unmount the disk image and do the next.

....
MOUNT C /home/myuser/winroot
C:
MD INSTALL
IMGMOUNT A DISK01.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK02.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK03.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK04.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK05.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A -U
....

Your new INSTALL directory now contains the contents of all 5 disks.

# Installing in a mounted folder

You are now ready to start DOSBox-X from the command-line, using the newly created win1x.conf config file.
This assumes that dosbox-x is in your path and win1x.conf is in your current directory.
....
dosbox-x -conf win1x.conf
....
You now need to mount your new folder as the C: drive in DOSBox-X, and the INSTALL directory on A: and start the installation.
....
MOUNT A /home/myuser/winroot/INSTALL
MOUNT C /home/myuser/winroot
A:
SETUP
....
Adjust the path for mounting the A: and C: drive as needed.

*Notes*

* If your path contains spaces, you need to enclose it in quotes. e.g. ``MOUNT C "C:\Users\John Doe\winroot"``


The Windows installation will now take place. See the link:#Windows-1.0x-setup-program[Windows 1.0x setup program] section below.

Adjust the path for mounting the C: drive as needed. If you don't want DOSBox-X to close when exiting Windows 1.0x, remove the ``EXIT`` command.

# Starting Windows 1.0x after installation
