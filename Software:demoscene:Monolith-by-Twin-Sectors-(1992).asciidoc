Demo description
----------------

(todo)

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=vgaonly
memsize=1

[cpu]
cycles=8000
core=normal
cputype=386

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2
sbbase=220
irq=5
dma=1
....

To run the demo type BOOT.BAT.

VGA oddities
------------

Part 4 of this demo (the greetings), prompts you on what VGA mode to use
to display a graphic. The first option uses a nonstandard VGA mode
360x570 (it’s actually 360x594) that is safe to use with DOSBox-X,
though not recommended for non-multisync VGA monitors. The second option
uses 360x480 (also safe). DOSBox-X has been updated to handle the
360x570 mode despite that some of the CRTC registers contain invalid
values.

Bugs
----

Running the demo with BOOT.BAT will run all sections properly, except
that part 3 will run without music. To run part 3 with music, run it
manually by typing ``PART3.EXE''. Answer `Y' when the part asks if you
want music.
