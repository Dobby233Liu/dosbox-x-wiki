Demo description
----------------

A demo that plays music while using hardware color palette animation to
scroll text. After that, there are some 3D dot landscapes and objects to
show off.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
memsize=2
machine=svga_et4000

[cpu]
cputype=386
core=normal
cycles=12000

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2
sbbase=220

[speaker]
initial frequency=0
....

The demo starts with a high resolution 640x480 256-color logo. This SVGA
logo requires an ET4000 to display properly.

The demo will turn on and leave on the PC speaker for some reason. Set
initial frequency to work around that issue.

Sound Blaster support does not require IRQ or DMA resources. It uses IRQ
0 and direct DAC commands to play music. The demo can also use parallel
port DACs, a Covox on 0x2CF (?), and the PC speaker as audio output. PC
speaker output is not recommended because the demo amplifies the music
too much to the point of clipping audibly.
