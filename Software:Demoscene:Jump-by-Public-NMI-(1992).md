    # they are HACKS to be used until the demo is further examined.
    pic unmask irq=true
    force dsp auto-init=true
    
    # alternatively, if you want to avoid the hacks and run it without problems, use the LPT DAC playback mode (and set cycles=7000)

To run the demo, type JUMP.BAT

# Bugs

## Sound Blaster IRQ problems

Sound Blaster playback is unreliable due to problems with managing the PIC interrupt mask for the Sound Blaster IRQ. It is not known whether DOSBox-X or the demo is at fault.

Test results so far:

|Hardware|Sound card|Result|
|--------|----------|------|
|Toshiba Satellite Pro 465CDX|Yamaha OPL3-SA2 (Sound Blaster compatible)|"Unlimited shadebob" music plays fine. Music stops after 1-2 seconds in other parts. Same as DOSBox|

## VGA blanking and the dot landscape

The dot landscape does not show up on screen if the cycle count is greater than about 7000. It also fails to appear on-screen on real 486 & Pentium hardware.
