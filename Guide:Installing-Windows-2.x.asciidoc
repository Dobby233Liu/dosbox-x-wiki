|===
Windows 2.x was available for both Retail and via OEM. A runtime version was also included with some applications.

*Windows 2.03* was followed by *Windows/286 2.10* and *Windows/286 2.11*.
The reason for the name change, is that version 2.10 includes HIMEM.SYS which requires at least a 286.
However, despite the 286 in the name, it will also run on 8086/8088 CPUs.

* Running Windows 2.03 requires at least DOS 2.0
* Running a Windows/286 edition requires at least DOS 3.0
* Running a Windows/386 edition requires at least DOS 3.1

## README.1ST
Windows 2.x has problems starting if the reported DOS version is 5.0 or higher.
Therefore it is necessary to set the reported DOS version to something like 4.0.

Windows/386 2.01 was the first Windows 2.x release, and meant for Compaq 386 computers.
As such it has a very small selection of drivers, and for instance no driver for PS/2 mouse.
Therefore if you want to run this version in DOSBox-X, you should enable ``serial1=serialmouse`` support.

Windows 2.1x will complain if the High Memory Area (HMA) is used.
This can be resolved by setting ``DOS=LOW`` in the [config] section of the DOSBox-X config file.

The Windows/386 editions install by default into ``C:\WIN386`` instead of ``C:\WINDOWS`` as all other Windows versions normally do.
And the command to start Windows/386 is ``win386.exe``, instead of the typical ``win.com`` of most other Windows versions at the time.
Windows/386 also has a ``win86.com`` executable, which is effectively a renamed ``win.com``, and this makes it possible to run Windows/386 on 8086 and 286 computers.

IMPORTANT: Unfortunately at this point only *Windows 2.03* works in the integrated DOS that DOSBox-X provides.
All other Windows/286 and Windows/386 editions need to be run from a real DOS.

# DOSBox-X config file
It is recommended that you create a custom DOSBox-X config file for running Windows 2.x
....
[sdl]
autolock=true

[dosbox]
title=Windows 2.x

[dos]
ver=4.0

[serial]
#uncomment if using Windows/386 2.01 which lacks PS/2 mouse support
#serial1=serialmouse

[parallel]
parallel1=printer

[printer]
multipage=true
timeout=5000

[render]
scaler=none

[config]
# this prevents Windows 2.1x from complaining that HMA is in use
dos=low

[autoexec]
....

Copy the above config and save it as *win2x.conf*

# Method 1 - Installing Windows 2.03 into a mounted folder
This method will *only* work for Windows 2.03.
It will not work for any other Windows 2.x version, including Windows/386 2.03.

For other Windows versions, please see Method 2 below.

## Preparing for installation
The installation will be into a mounted folder, and Windows 2.03 will run from the integrated DOS that DOSBox-X provides.
You can optionally install real DOS into DOSBox-X and install Windows 2.03 in that, but there is no known advantage to doing so.

Start by creating a directory on your system that your going to use (mount) as your Windows 2.03 C: drive.
Valid examples:

* For Windows hosts
** C:\winroot
** C:\users\myuser\win2x
* For Linux hosts
** /home/myuser/winroot
** /home/myuser/windows/win2x

Note: For Windows users, do *NOT* mount the root of your C: drive as the DOSBox-X C: drive! (e.g. ``MOUNT C C:\`` should NOT be done)

Windows 2.x versions were shipped on diskettes, requiring anywhere between 4 and 10 disks, depending on media-type and windows version.
And while it is definitely possible to install Windows 2.x from diskette images in DOSBox-X, the disk-swap process for this is rather tedious for large number of disks.
As such it is highly recommended to make a directory such as "INSTALL" and copy the contents of ALL the diskettes into this directory.
This way there is no need to swap disks during the installation process.

### Example of extracting files from disk images
There are various ways to extract the contents of disk images, such as 7zip on Windows or "Disk Image Mounter" on Linux.
In this example, DOSBox-X itself is used to mount a disk image, copy its contents into a folder, unmount the disk image and do the next.

....
MOUNT C /home/myuser/winroot
C:
MD INSTALL
IMGMOUNT A DISK01.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK02.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK03.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK04.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A DISK05.IMG -U
XCOPY A:\. C:\INSTALL /S /Y
IMGMOUNT A -U
....
Your new INSTALL directory now contains the contents of all 5 disks.

## Installing in a mounted folder

You are now ready to start DOSBox-X from the command-line, using the newly created win2x.conf config file.
This assumes that dosbox-x is in your path and win2x.conf is in your current directory.
....
dosbox-x -conf win2x.conf
....
You now need to mount your new folder as the C: drive in DOSBox-X and start the installation.
....
MOUNT C /home/myuser/winroot
C:
CD INSTALL
SETUP
....
Adjust the path for mounting the C: drive as needed.

*Notes*

* If your path contains spaces, you need to enclose it in quotes. e.g. ``MOUNT C "C:\Users\John Doe\winroot"``

The Windows installation will now take place. See the link:#Windows-2.x-setup-program[Windows 2.x setup program] section below.

# Method 2 - Installing in real DOS
This method is required for most Windows 2.x versions, and requires that you create a DOS HDD image.

In addition, it brings with it several inconveniences.
For instance you will need to do your own DOS memory management and load DOS drivers for CD-ROM access if you need it.
You can also not mount a host directory in DOSBox-X when you boot a disk image.
Even host directories that you mounted prior to booting the disk image will become unavailable.
Everything needs to be done using IMAGE files.

The first step is to create a DOS HDD image, for which you can follow the link:Guide%3ADOS-Installation-in-DOSBox‐X[PC DOS and MS-DOS Installation Guide].
It is recommended to use at least DOS 3.1, as it is compatible with all Windows 2.x releases.
When using DOS 5.0 or higher however, it will be necessary to use link:https://web.csulb.edu/~murdock/setver.html[SETVER] to make Windows 2.x think your using and older DOS version like 4.0.

Once you have a DOS HDD image, temporarily mount it in DOSBox-X to transfer your INSTALL folder into your DOS HDD image, together with any drivers and add-ons you might need (preferably already unzipped, such that you don't need to do that in DOS or Windows 3.x, as they lack support for that by default).

Something along the lines of:

....
IMGMOUNT C hdd.img
MOUNT D .
XCOPY D:\INSTALL C:\INSTALL /I /S
XCOPY D:\DRIVERS C:\DRIVERS /I /S
XCOPY D:\ADDONS C:\ADDONS /I /S
EXIT
....
Adjust paths in the above example as needed.

Now edit your win2x.conf config file and in the [autoexec] section at the end, add the following lines:
....
IMGMOUNT C hdd.img
BOOT C:
....

Now start DOSBox-X with your win2x.conf config file from the command-line:

....
dosbox-x -conf win2x.conf
....

It should boot to the C: prompt, and you can start the installation process
....
CD INSTALL
SETUP
....

After the installation is finished, you can install your drivers and add-ons.

# Windows 2.x setup program
The setup program will ask several question relating to mouse, display, keyboard, region and printer.

Note: the below screenshots are from the retail Windows 2.03 release, other releases can vary.
In particular OEM or Runtime versions may have a different number of disks and present other options.

The setup program is now finished, and your ready to start Windows 2.x.

But first type ``EXIT`` to close DOSBox-X.

And then edit your win2x.conf config file and add the following lines into the [autoexec] section at the end of the file:

....
MOUNT C /home/myuser/winroot
C:
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS;
C:\WINDOWS\WIN
EXIT
....

Adjust the path for mounting the C: drive as needed. If you don't want DOSBox-X to close when exiting Windows 2.x, remove the ``EXIT`` command.

# Starting Windows 2.x after installation
After the installation is finished, you can start Windows 2.x from the command-prompt with the following command:

....
dosbox-x -conf win2x.conf
....
