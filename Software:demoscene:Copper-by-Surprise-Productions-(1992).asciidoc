VGA raster tricks used in the demo
----------------------------------

This demo employs a lot of VGA raster trickery, in addition to the usual
changing the color palette per scanline to make copper bars. The most
dangerous trick not likely to work with todays monitors is to make the
picture waver by changing the position of the horizontal sync pulse once
per scanline. That trick may happen to work with older VGA CRT monitors,
but will cause modern flat panels and scan converters to blank the
picture.

Adlib FM synthesizer music
--------------------------

The demo will autodetect and use the Adlib FM synthesizer of your sound
card. The detection however is CPU speed sensitive. If the cycle count
is 13000 or higher, detection will fail and you will hear no music.
Music tempo is tied to the VGA refresh rate. If the refresh rate is
anything other than 70Hz music will play too fast or too slow.
