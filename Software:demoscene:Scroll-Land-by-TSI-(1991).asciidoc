Demo description
----------------

A demo that plays music in a loop with cue points combined with color
palette cycling effects to scroll text messages. If music is playing,
additional color palette work is used to flash white text to the beat of
the music.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
memsize=1

[cpu]
core=normal
cputype=386
cycles=4000

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2
sbbase=220
irq=3
dma=1
....

Sound Blaster support oddity
----------------------------

This demo appears to use undocumented [[Sound Blaster DSP
commands|Hardware:Sound-Blaster:DSP-commands]] [[0xE2 (DMA
identification)|Hardware:Sound-Blaster:DSP-commands:0xE2]], [[0xE4
(write test register)|Hardware:Sound-Blaster:DSP-commands:0xE4]], and
[[0xE8 (read test register)|Hardware:Sound-Blaster:DSP-commands:0xE8]]
in addition to [[0xE0 (SB2.0
identification)|Hardware:Sound-Blaster:DSP-commands:0xE0]] and [[0xE1
(Get DSP version)|Hardware:Sound-Blaster:DSP-commands:0xE1]].

For reasons unknown at this time, it also appears to assume the Sound
Blaster is on IRQ 3.

Problems
--------

This demo appears to have a problem exiting back to DOS. Hitting space
only causes the demo to freeze (but the music keeps going).
