Demo description
----------------

Basic demo with scrolling starfield, meters, and MOD music.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=vgaonly
memsize=1
iodelay=0

[cpu]
cycles=5000
core=normal
cputype=386

[speaker]
pcspeaker=true
initial frequency=0
....

Demo uses the internal PC speaker for music. A bug in the demo leaves
the PC speaker on before the music starts, you can eliminiate the
initial long beep by setting ``initial frequency=0''. Music is amplified
and slightly distorted. You can hear a higher quality rendition by using
a dedicated MOD player like http://mikmod.sourceforge.net/[MikMod] or
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html[VLC player] to play the files.

How to run
----------

Mount the demo so that it is visible under a drive letter in DOSBox. The
demo expects you to run TORSO.BAT so that it can display a message, wait
for you to hit enter, then run the demo (P.COM).

....
It was only a Test-version but the SOURCE is lost.
So enjoy this last version.

You can run the demo as intended:

....
call torso.bat
....

Or jump directly into the demo:

....
P.COM
....

DOSBox-X bugs
-------------

Scratchy PC speaker audio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Except when core=dynamic, PC speaker audio gets ``scratchy'' when a lot
of video redraw happens, or during VGA palette fades. Until resolved,
the workaround is to set iodelay=0.
