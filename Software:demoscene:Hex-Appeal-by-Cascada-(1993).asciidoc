Demo description
----------------

Cascada production with warping title text, Mode-X 320x400 dot objects,
and a rotating texture cube. On startup, the demo prompts you to select
a sound card. If a mouse was detected, you will have to use the mouse to
select items. You will need to click the ``begin'' button center-bottom
to start the demo. Gravis Ultrasound is recommended. Sound Blaster
support works but every so often will have audible ``buzzing'' glitches.
The ``PC speaker'' playback mode will only give you loud overly
distorted audio, don’t use it. LPT DAC modes generally work but with
some audible crackling and some parts, like the warping closing credits,
will slow to a crawl if LPT DAC playback is used.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
memsize=1
machine=svga_s3

[cpu]
core=normal
cputype=pentium
cycles=19000

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2

[gus]
gus=true
gusirq=5
gusdma=1

[speaker]

....

Known problems
--------------

If you select Gravis Ultrasound playback, the demo does not exit by
itself. After the rotating multiple-textured code, the starfield will
run by itself forever until you hit ESC to exit the demo. In any other
playback mode, the demo runs to the end by itself.
