Demo description
----------------

(todo)

Two versions of the demo were released. Version 1.0 (unreal.zip), and
version 1.1 (unreal11.zip). Version 1.1 has Gravis Ultrasound support
but removes the funny back-and-forth between two scrollers in the second
part.

Recommended DOSBox-X configuration
----------------------------------

....
[dosbox]
machine=vgaonly
memsize=2

[cpu]
cycles=25000
core=normal
cputype=386

[sblaster]
sbtype=sbpro2

[gus]
gus=true
....

Version 1.1 of the demo has GUS support. For v1.0, select ``Sound
Blaster Pro''.

Bugs
----

Version 1.0 Sound Blaster playback will stop after part 3 (World
Vector).

The vectorballs part (both versions) will flicker if the cycles count is
between 8000 and 22000. Not sure if this is a DOSBox-X bug or a bug in
the demo.

Future enhancements for DOSBox-X
--------------------------------

Version 1.0 apparently supports the

II]. Version 1.1 replaces that selection with Gravis Ultrasound support.
